Acerta Remote API Access

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The scripts in this directory provide a convenient way to access Acerta's
publicly available remote API.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## System Requirements

Python = 2.7.x
Pip >= 1.x

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Setup

The setup.sh bash script can be run to install the required python libraries.
Python and Pip are expected to be already installed on the system.

Usage: ./setup.sh

NOTE: Pip will likely need root access to install the required packages. Run
sudo ./setup.sh in that case.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Configuration

The config.py file containts the configuration for the scripts.

The "LOGIN Credentials" section should be modified to include the correct
credentials to access Acerta's servers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## API access scripts

This section contains the description and usage information for each of the
API access scripts provided.

NOTE: If your system uses 'python' for Python 3.x by default, use 'python2'
to run the scripts below with Python 2.7.x.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### create_system.py

Usage: python create_system.py system_name

Args1: system_name is the desired name of the system

The script will create a system (for example, "baseline" to contain all the
baseline traces; or "test1" to contain test traces from one test run).

NOTE: System names must be unique. Use 'list_systems.py' (next) to see the
existing systems.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### list_systems.py

Usage: python list_systems.py

The script will list the existing systems on the server including their IDs and
names.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### delete_system.py

Usage: python delete_system.py system_name

Args1: system_name is the name of the system

The script will delete the system and all its associated trace files from the
server. Caution, the system and its traces cannot be recovered after the
operation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### list_traces.py

Usage: python list_traces.py

The script will list the existing systems on the server and all their traces.
Each system listing includes the system ID and name.
Each trace listing includes the trace ID, name, and type.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### list_sys_traces.py

Usage: python list_sys_traces.py system_name

Args1: system_name is the name of the system

The script will list all traces for the specified system.
Each trace listing includes the trace ID, name, and type.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### delete_trace.py

Usage: python delete_trace.py system_name trace_id

Args1: system_name is the name of the system
Args2: trace_id is the id of the trace

The script will delete the specified trace from the given system.
If the trace is not part of the specified system, no change will occur.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### upload_trace.py

Usage: python upload_trace.py system_name file_path [type]

Args1: system_name is the name of the system
Args2: file_path is the path to the trace file to be uploaded to the specified
       system
Args3: type is an optional argument that specifies the type of the system trace;
       the type indicates the system from which the trace was collected;
       when not specified, the script attempts to automatically determine the
       type based on the trace extension; if it does not succeed, it will ask
       the user to specify the type explicitly.

       The following are the currently supported types:
       1. QNX
       2. CAN

       The following are the automatically supported extensions:
       1. .kev, .trace
       2. .asc, .csv

The script will upload the specified trace to the server and include it as part
of the specified system. Check the "Compressed trace files" section for
information about the support for compressed trace files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### upload_tracedir.py

Usage: python upload_tracedir.py system_name dir_path [type]

Args1: system_name is the name of the system
Args2: dir_path is the path to the directory that contains the trace files to be
       uploaded to the specified system;
       the script will attempt to upload each file found within the directory;
Args3: type is an optional argument that specifies the type of the system trace;
       please refer to the argument description in the "upload_trace.py" section


The script will upload the traces found in the specified directory to the
server and include them as part of the specified system. The trace files are
added to the system, no existing system traces are removed. Check the
"Compressed trace files" section for information about the support for
compressed trace files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Compressed trace files

Large trace files may take a while to be uploaded to the server. To improve the
upload performance Acerta supports the upload of comressed traces.

The following compressions are supported:
1. gzip
2. bzip2
3. xz

The type of compression used will be identified based on the file extension.
